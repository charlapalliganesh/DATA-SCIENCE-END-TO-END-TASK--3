## Key Components

- **Data Collection**  
  Loading and understanding the dataset.

- **Data Preprocessing**  
  - Handling missing values  
  - Encoding categorical variables  
  - Feature scaling / normalization

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  - Visualization of distributions  
  - Correlation analysis  
  - Feature importance insights

- **Model Building**  
  - Train-test split  
  - Model selection (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)  
  - Hyperparameter tuning

- **Model Evaluation**  
  - Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score  
  - Confusion matrix  
  - ROC-AUC curve

- **Conclusion**  
  Summary of model performance and insights.
